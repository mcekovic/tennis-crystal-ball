event.participation.title=Participation percentage measures how much the best players participate in the draw (100% if all top players participate in the draw). Formula: sum(ParticipationWeight(rank)) / sum(ParticipationWeight(1..PlayerCount)): i.e. sum of participation weights of all players in the draw compared to maximal participation weight if all top players would have been participated, where participation weight depend on ranking (see Participation Weights in the Glossary page).
event.strength.title=Tournament strength measures how hard is to win a tournament based on weighted Elo ratings of the participating players. Formula: sum(ParticipationWeight(EloSeeding) * (Elo - 1500) / 400) * BestOfFactor, i.e. weighted sum of participating players strengths based on Elo Rating multiplied by best-of factor: 1.25 for Grand Slam, 1 for other tournaments (better player has 25% more chances to win in best-of-5 compared to best-of-3), where weight depend on Elo-based seeding (see Participation Weights in the Glossary page).
event.averageEloRating.title=Average Elo rating measures average strength of the participating players. Formula: sum(ParticipationWeight(EloSeeding) * EloRating) / sum(ParticipationWeight(1..PlayerCount)), i.e. weighted average of participating players Elo ratings at the beginning of the tournament, where weight depend on Elo-based seeding (see Participation Weights in the Glossary page).
event.participationWeights.title=Participation weights: Weights of players participating in the tournament based on their ranking or seeding (depends on context): [1: 100, 2: 85, 3: 75, 4: 67, 5: 60, 6: 55, 7-8: 50, 9-10: 45, 11-13: 40, 14-16: 35, 17-20: 30, 21-25: 25, 26-30: 20, 31-35: 16, 36-40: 13, 41-45: 10, 46-50: 8, 51-60: 6, 61-70: 5, 71-80: 4, 81-100: 3, 101-150: 2, 151-200: 1]
event.courtSpeed.title=Court Speed Index (0 - 100): 50 * cube-root(Ace % * (Service Points Won % - 50%) * (Service Games Won % - 60%)) - 3, where statistics figures (percentages) are adjusted with figure season average for each participating player
event.titleDifficulty.title=Factor of difficulty to win the title compared to a difficulty for an average title winner to win an average tournament event of the same tournament level (calculation steps: first, probabilities to win the title for an average title winner of the same tournament level are calculated based on average Elo Ratings of the title winners as well as Elo Ratings of the opponents the actual winner has faced (P = 1 / (1 + 10 ^ ((AvgWinnerElo - ActualOpponentElo) / 400)); second, difficulty to win the title is calculated as the sum of inverse probabilities from the first step; third, title difficulty is normalized so that the average difficulty of the same tournament level is 1). Example: Difficulty Factor of 1.315 means that a title was 31.5% harder to win compared to an average title of the same tournament level.
match.greatnessScore.title=Match Greatness Score is proportional to match factor (depending on tournament level and round as in Big Wins), player rankings factor (as in Big Wins), player career high rankings factor (as in Big Wins), player Elo Ratings (((WinnerElo - 1500) / 400 + (LoserElo - 1500) / 400) / 2) and match length (sqrt(sets * (games + 2 * tie breaks)))
forecast.drawLuck.title=Draw Luck represents how much player has benefited or penalized with the actual draw compared to the average draw. It is calculated as relative difference in title winning percentage of the actual draw compared to the average draw.
forecast.drawBonus.title=Draw Bonus represents how much player has benefited or penalized with the actual draw. It is calculated as relative difference in title winning percentage of the actual draw compared to the average draw without seeding and random byes. Thus Draw Bonus incorporates both draw luck and draw seeding factors.

player.surfaceSpecialization.title=Surface Specialization rating quantifies how much player is specialized in his favorite surface. Rating of 50% means that player performance on favorite surface is at least twice as good as on the worst surface. Theoretical rating of 100% is used when player wins all matches on favorite surface and loses all matches on the least favorite surface. Relative difference between two winning percentages is calculated as arithmetic mean of the relative difference between winning percentages and the relative difference between corresponding losing percentages. Examples: difference between 50% and 60% is 18%, between 60% and 80% is 37%, between 80% and 90% is 31%.
